## Correction assistant
This repo contains a script to aid a teacher in keeping track of what students they have corrected and opening each project with their favourite editor automatically to check the file contents.

It can also help runing a script through the projects main function and checking if the program matches the expected output with a set of inputs. Check the 'run_program' function.

The program takes as an only argument: the name of one of the files the project will contain.
